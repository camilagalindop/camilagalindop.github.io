I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Universidad de los Andes. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Chicago's Department of Economics and the John Mitchell Economics of Poverty Lab. I have also worked as a consultant for Latin America and Africa at the World Bank. I completed my PhD in Economics at the University of Maryland in 2021. 

My research interests include labor economics, the economics of education, early childhood development, and applied econometrics.
