I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Universidad de los Andes. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Chicago's Department of Economics and the John Mitchell Economics of Poverty Lab. I have also worked as a consultant for Latin America and Africa at the World Bank. I completed my PhD in Economics at the University of Maryland in 2021. 

My research interests include labor economics, the economics of education, early childhood development, and applied econometrics.

For more information, you can find my curriculum vitae [here](https://camilagalindop.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_CamilaGalindo.pdf) and contact me at <a href="mailto:camilagalindo@uniandes.edu.co">camilagalindo@uniandes.edu.co</a>.
